Q) what are marker interfaces? if they dont have any methods why they exist?
- marker interfaces are used to apply certain rules on the creation or usage
- they dont have any methods
- but serve as a "marker" or "tag" for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to perform special operations on the marked class

- lets say you have a class and you want to preverse thee state of that class into a file
like below
 // Serialize the instance to a file
            try (ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(
                    new FileOutputStream("singleton.ser"))) {
                out.writeObject(instance1);
            }
 you want to preserve the instance of the class to a file named singleton.ser
 - and lets say you are not implementing the Serializable interface in the instance1 class
 then  This will throw "java.io.NotSerializableException"
 - This is because the ObjectOutputStream checks if the class implements the Serializable
 marker interface before attempting serialization.
 - The marker interface acts as a flag to the JVM that this class can be serialized.

 Predicate Functional interface
 Predicate its a functional interface which has a method called as test()
 -
 // Predicate to find IT department employee
 // Predicate to find employees with salary > 60000
 // Chaining predicates: IT employees with high salary(> 60000)

 // checking the validity of an email
 1) email should not be null
 2)email should contain @
 3) and email should end with .com
