User → Booking Service → Inventory Service → Payment Service → Notification Service

1)users hit the request for booking tickets from mobile or from web app
- there are n number of users who will try to book the tickets from mobile or from web app
2)
- each request will go to API gateway -- here, at api gateway level, we will handle security and rate limiting

3)there are different micro services like
- ticket booking service
- payment service
- user service
- notification service
- seat availability(inventory) service
- auth service

4)
each service can have its own load balancer to handle the load

5)also there will be messaging queue , each service will send event details
like when user books a ticket, it sends TICKET_BOOKING_INITIATED event to queue
then consumers like inventory service will consume this event and update the inventory
then payment service will consume this event and update the payment status
then notification service will consume this event and send the notification
like wise ...

6) then we will use postgre sql to store booking , payment info
- because it avoids duplicate bookings
- handle locking
- saving payment transaction

7) we will use mongo db where read operations are more
- like sear layout
- user booking history
- entire seat map etc
8) also in between the db layer, we will use cache like redis cache or memcached
- to reduce latency
- movie booking system is read heavy system
- to get faster reponse, we will use cache
- in cache, we will store movies, seat availability, pricing, offers,
frequently accessed metadata (theatre details, screen info etc)
