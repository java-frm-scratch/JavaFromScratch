High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions.


Simple meaning:
⭐ Your main business logic should depend on interfaces, not concrete classes.
⭐ Avoid “new” keyword inside business logic—inject dependencies instead.


This is the backbone of clean architecture, microservices, Spring Boot, .NET DI container, etc.

======================================
Real-World Analogy (Super Easy)
Imagine you buy a mobile phone charger.
You don’t care:

which company made the charger
how it works internally

You only care that it supports the USB port.
So the phone depends on the USB standard (interface)…
NOT on the concrete charger!
➡ Phone depends on abstraction → NOT concrete implementation.
This is DIP.

=========================================

 Benefits of DIP
✔ Loose coupling
High-level code is not tied to low-level classes.
✔ Easy to switch implementations
Want Stripe instead of PayPal?
Just change the injected class → no code modifications.
✔ Highly testable
You can inject mocks or stubs in unit tests.
✔ Supports OCP
Add new implementations without changing existing logic.
✔ Clean, scalable architecture
Used in:

Spring Dependency Injection
.NET Dependency Injection Container
Clean Architecture
Onion Architecture
