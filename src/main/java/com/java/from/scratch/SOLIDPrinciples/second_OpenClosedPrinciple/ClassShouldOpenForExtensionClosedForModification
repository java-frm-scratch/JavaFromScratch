Open for Extension
- same class should not be modified when you add new payment methods
- create a payment strategy interface
- create seperate classes(WalletPayment, CreditCardPayment etc) and implemnt PaymentStrategy interface
- in this way , we keep extension of classes
- so in future any new payment comes then we can happily add new class instead of touching existing code

Closed for modification
- create PaymentService class
- create object reference of PayemmntStrategy inside this service
- create makePayment inside it
- call pay method inside makepayment class
-No matter how many payment methods you add, this class never changes.


✔ Open for Extension
Add:

NetBanking
Crypto
EMI
→ Just create new classes.

✔ Closed for Modification
No changes in:

PaymentService
PaymentStrategy

✔ Loose coupling
Code depends on an interface → not concrete implementations.
✔ High Cohesion
Each payment class does exactly one job.
