Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.


Problem:
lets say your company sends email after order is complete.
and not supports sms, whatsup, push notification
so you should design an interface which deals with sending emails
dont add everthing sending sms, whatsapp message, push notification in a
single interface

short: Split the large interface into smaller, focused interfaces.


in simple meaning:
 dont create big interfaces with n number of methods
if its not required
if you do so , then your class must need to implement those methods
and even though you send exception from it, then aslo its very
bad design
here also, if any change in interface will force to implement
all classes t folow the change



Simple meaning:
⭐ Don’t create giant interfaces.
⭐ Create small, specific interfaces.
⭐ A class should implement only what it needs—not more.

 Real-Time Problem (from real-world software)
🎯 Scenario:
You are building an Order Notification System.
Notifications include:

Email notification
SMS notification
WhatsApp notification
Push app notification

So you create one large interface:

public interface NotificationService {
    void sendEmail(String message);
    void sendSms(String message);
    void sendWhatsapp(String message);
    void sendPush(String message);
}

 Problem
Let’s say a company uses only Email and SMS, so you implement:

public class EmailNotificationService implements NotificationService {
    @Override
    public void sendEmail(String message) { ... }

    @Override
    public void sendSms(String message) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("SMS not supported");
    }

    @Override
    public void sendWhatsapp(String message) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("WhatsApp not supported");
    }

    @Override
    public void sendPush(String message) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Push not supported");
    }
}

What’s wrong?

You are forced to implement methods you don’t need.
You end up throwing UnsupportedOperationException.
If someone calls sendPush() → your app crashes.
The interface is fat, bloated, not reusable.
Any change in the interface forces all implementations to change → violates OCP too.

This is a real problem many enterprise systems face.
