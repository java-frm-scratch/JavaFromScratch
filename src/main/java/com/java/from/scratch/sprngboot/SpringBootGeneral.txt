Q1.
I have application.properties file as well as application.yaml file withing the same  spring boot application
then is it allowed? if allowed, then which one we should use? and which one will have the highest priority?
and what is the best recommended approach in industry?


Ans:

Yes, it's perfectly valid to have both application.properties and application.yml in the same Spring Boot application. Spring Boot supports this scenario with a specific order of precedence.

application.properties   (HIGHER priority)
application.yml          (LOWER priority)
If the same key exists in both → application.properties wins

*
YAML is Preferred in most cases because:
More readable for complex hierarchical configurations
Supports comments
Better for multi-line values
More concise for nested properties
*
Use .properties when:
Working with older Spring Boot versions with limited YAML support
You prefer a simpler, flatter structure
Working with tools that have better .properties support


Use application.yml as your primary configuration file
Use profile-specific files (e.g., application-dev.yml, application-prod.yml) for environment-specific configurations
Keep all configuration in one place rather than splitting between .properties and .yml
If you need to override specific properties for different environments, use environment variables or command-line arguments which have higher precedence than both .properties and .yml files
This approach provides a good balance of maintainability, readability, and flexibility for most Spring Boot applications.
