1)JVM starts and loaads Tester.class
2)main method is invoked
3)stack frame created
 4)below will be get called is called
ConfigurableApplicationContext context =
        SpringApplication.run(Tester.class, args);
form here everything is spring esponsibility
5)spring creates AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext
- this is application context container
6) at thsi point empty application context container will be created No car, no engine
7) @SpringBootApplication will get processed
8)it internally has below 3 annotations
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
9) component scanning will start
10) in scanning, it founds 2 objects are there Car and Engine-- still no object creation
11)then spring bean definations (metadata) will be get creaetd
BeanDefinition: car
Class: Car
Scope: singleton
Lazy: false
DependsOn: engine

BeanDefinition: engine
Class: Engine
Scope: singleton

12) this is just info no object created yet
13)below bean factory is internally rady
ApplicationContext
 └── DefaultListableBeanFactory

14)this factory knows(since it read metadata first)
- which beans are there
- which beans need to created
15)singleton bean creation starts
16)Engine bean will get created first
spring uses reflection
calls constructor new engine() to create bean
stores instance in singleton cache

17)Car bean will get created
- detects dependencies
- fetch enfine bean
calls constructor and awt bean
eg: new Car(engine)
and then it will store it to singleton pool
18)
then post processors will run
19)then it returns the context
now this line completes
ConfigurableApplicationContext context = ...
20)
when we do
 Car car = context.getBean(Car.class);
 spring loks in singleton cache,
 finds car bean
 and returns it
================================
Lazy VS eager initialization
1)
by default eager initialization will be there
- constructor will get called forst to create an instance of the object
2)
by @Lazy annotation you can use to to lazily create instances when you call getBean method,
then only instance will get created
===============================================
