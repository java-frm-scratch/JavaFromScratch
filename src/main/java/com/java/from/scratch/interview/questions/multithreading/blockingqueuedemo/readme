lets say producer is there and he keeps producing .. and lets say system is full
then producer waits until system is available again

and let say consumer is there
and consumer is consuming, and continuously consuming
and lets say there are items present , in the queue, then consumer waits until there
some order comes inside the queue

this all can be achieved by using BlockingQueue
without using wait/ notify manually
